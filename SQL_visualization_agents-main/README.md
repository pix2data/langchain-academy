# SQL Visualization Multi-Agent System

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive plan and example implementation for a SQL visualization multi-agent system built using LangGraph techniques from the LangChain Academy repository.

## Files

- **`plan.md`**: Comprehensive system architecture and implementation plan
- **`example_sql_agent.py`**: Example implementation of the SQL Query Generation Agent
- **`README.md`**: This overview document

## System Components

### 1. Data Ingestion Agent/Workflow
- Handles loading data from various SQL sources (.dat files, databases)
- Performs schema discovery and data validation
- Uses parallel processing for multiple data sources

### 2. SQL Query Generation Agent *(Example Provided)*
- Translates natural language questions to SQL queries
- Understands database relationships and foreign keys
- Includes human-in-the-loop approval process
- Provides query validation and refinement

### 3. Data Analysis Workflow
- Performs statistical analysis and anomaly detection
- Calculates metrics like mean, standard deviation, etc.
- Uses parallel processing for multiple analysis types

### 4. Visualization Agent
- Creates appropriate charts and graphs based on data and user intent
- Supports multiple output formats (PNG, SVG, PDF)
- Provides interactive and static visualization options

## Key LangGraph Techniques Used

### Multi-Agent Coordination
- **Sub-graphs**: Isolated state management for each agent
- **Send() API**: Parallel processing using map-reduce patterns
- **State Management**: Structured data flow between agents

### Human-in-the-Loop
- **Breakpoints**: Strategic interruption points for human review
- **State Editing**: Allow manual modifications to agent outputs
- **Dynamic Breakpoints**: Conditional stops based on confidence scores

### Robustness Features
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
- **State Persistence**: Checkpoint saving with MemorySaver
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for failed operations

### Advanced Patterns
- **Conditional Routing**: Smart decision-making between workflow paths
- **Tool Integration**: Custom tools for database operations and validation
- **Structured Output**: Pydantic models for reliable data parsing

## Implementation Highlights

The example SQL agent demonstrates:

1. **State Schema Design**: Using TypedDict and MessagesState for structured communication
2. **Tool Development**: Custom tools for schema analysis and SQL validation
3. **Node Implementation**: Following LangGraph patterns for stateful processing
4. **Graph Construction**: Proper edge definition and conditional routing
5. **Human Integration**: Breakpoints for query approval and refinement

## Getting Started

1. Review the `plan.md` for complete system architecture
2. Examine `example_sql_agent.py` for implementation patterns
3. Follow the 5-week implementation roadmap in the plan
4. Adapt the patterns to your specific data sources and requirements

## Key Benefits

- **Scalable Architecture**: Handle multiple data sources and concurrent users
- **Reliable Processing**: Built-in error handling and human oversight
- **Flexible Visualization**: Adaptive chart generation based on data characteristics
- **Extensible Design**: Easy to add new agents or modify existing workflows

## Dependencies

Core requirements from the LangGraph ecosystem:
- `langgraph`: Multi-agent orchestration
- `langchain-core`: LLM integration
- `langchain-openai`: OpenAI model integration
- `pandas`: Data manipulation
- `pydantic`: Data validation

Additional recommended packages listed in the full plan.

This system leverages the full power of LangGraph's multi-agent capabilities to provide a robust, scalable solution for SQL data visualization with comprehensive error handling, human oversight, and extensibility.
